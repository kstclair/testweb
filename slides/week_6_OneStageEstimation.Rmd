## Design: One-Stage Cluster  Sample 

**Definition**: Divide all population **observation units** into $N$ non-overlapping **clusters** of observation units.

## Design: One-Stage Cluster  Sample 


**Defined**: We take a SRS of $n$ **clusters** and survey **every observation unit** in selected clusters.

## Design: Cluster vs. Stratified sampling

Take a SRS **within** each strata

## Design: One-Stage Cluster  Sample 

- **Primary Sampling Units (PSU):** clusters

--

- **Secondary Sampling Units (SSU):** observation units

  - $y_{ij}$ is the measurement for unit $j$ in cluster $i$
  
  - $M_i$ is the number of observation units in cluster $i$
  
  - $M_0 = \sum_{i=1}^N M_i$ is the total number of observation units in the population


---


## Design: One-Stage Cluster  Sample 

Why?

- Can be **cheaper** than a SRS 

- A sampling frame of clusters may exist but a sampling frame of observation units does not. 

---

## Example 1: GPA
A student wants to estimate the average GPA in his dormitory. The dorm consists of 100 suites, each with four students. He chooses a SRS of 5 of these suites and records the GPA of each student living in the suite.

---

## Example 2 - residents
Suppose you are interested in surveying the 11,482 adults who reside permanently in Northfield. You divide the town into 400 blocks and take a SRS of 5 blocks. You then visit each adult resident who lives on a selected block and record their annual income (in thousands of dollars) and whether or not they identify their political affiliation as Democratic.

---

## Inclusion probabilities: One-Stage Cluster 

What is the probability that unit $j$ from cluster $i$ is selected?
 

---

## Sampling weights:  One-Stage Cluster 

What is the sampling weight for  unit $j$ from cluster $i$ under a one-stage cluster design?

---

## Estimation plan:  One-Stage Cluster 

- **One option!** Use an **unbiased** Horvitz-Thompson estimator to estimate the (overall) **population total**

$$\hat{t}_{HT} = \sum_{\textrm{sampled units}} w_{ij} y_{ij}$$


---

## Population Total: One-Stage Cluster 

- **Parameter**: $t = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} y_{ij}=  \sum_{i=1}^N t_i$


--

- **Unbiased Estimator:** 
$$\hat{t}_{unb} =  \dfrac{N}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n t_{i} = N\bar{t}$$
where $\bar{t}$ is the sample mean **total response** per cluster



--


- **Standard error:**
$$SE(\hat{t}_{unb}) = N \sqrt{\left(1- \dfrac{n}{N} \right) \dfrac{s^{2}_{t}}{n}}$$
where $s_t$ is the sample standard deviation of cluster totals.

--

- **Confidence interval:** Use a t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom

---


## Population Mean: One-Stage Cluster 


- **Parameter**: $\bar{y}_{\mathcal{U}} = \dfrac{t}{M_0}$

- **Assume that $M_0$ is known!**

--

- **Unbiased Estimator:**
$$\hat{\bar{y}}_{unb} = \dfrac{\hat{t}_{unb} }{M_{0}}$$

- **Standard error:**
$$SE(\hat{\bar{y}}_{unb}) = \dfrac{SE(\hat{t}_{unb})}{M_{0}}$$


---


## Population Proportion: One-Stage Cluster 


- **Parameter**: $p = \dfrac{t}{M_0}$

- Use formulas for mean where $t_{i}$ counts the number of observation units in cluster $i$ that are a "success"


---

## Example 1 - GPA

$N = 100$, $n = 5$, $M_i = 4$, $M_0  = 400$


  |  Suite 1  |  Suite 2  |  Suite 3  |  Suite 4  |  Suite 5 
----- | ------ | ------- | ----- | ----- | ---- 
1  |  3.08  |  2.36  |  2.00  |  3.00  |  2.68 
2  |  2.60  |  3.04  |  2.56  |  2.88  |  1.92 
3  |  3.44  |  3.28  |  2.52  |  3.44  |  3.28 
4  |  3.04  |  2.68  |  1.88  |  3.64  |  3.20 
total  |  12.16  |  11.36  |  8.96  |  12.96  |  11.08 

Estimate/SE for the mean GPA in the population.

## Population Mean: One-Stage Cluster 


- **Parameter**: $\bar{y}_{\mathcal{U}} = \dfrac{t}{M_0}$

- **What if $M_0$ is unknown!**

---


## Population Mean: One-Stage Cluster 


- **Parameter**: $\bar{y}_{\mathcal{U}} = \dfrac{t}{M_0}$

- **Assume that $M_0$ is unknown**

--

- **Biased Ratio Estimator:**
$$\hat{\bar{y}} _{r} = \dfrac{ \sum_{i=1}^n t_{i} }{ \sum_{i=1}^n M_{i} }$$

--

- **Standard error:** for large $n$:

$$SE(\hat{\bar{y}}_{r}) \approx \sqrt{\left( 1- \dfrac{n}{N}\right) \dfrac{1}{n \bar{M}^{2}} \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n (t_{i} - \hat{\bar{y}}_{r} M_{i})^{2}}{n-1}}$$


---


## Population Total: One-Stage Cluster 


- **Parameter**: $t = M_0\bar{y}_{\mathcal{U}}$

- **Assume that $M_0$ is known!!**

--

- **Biased Ratio Estimator:**
$$\hat{t} _{r} = M_0\hat{\bar{y}} _{r}$$


- **Standard error:** for large $n$
$$SE(\hat{t}_{r}) \approx M_0 SE(\hat{\bar{y}}_{r})$$


---


## One-Stage Cluster estimation options:


- Unbiased vs. Biased:  

  - Biased (ratio) options could be more precise than unbiased options when $t_i$ and $M_i$ are positively correlated
  
- Bias of ratio options:

  - need large $n$ for bias to be small

## Example 2 - residents

$N = 400, n = 5$ 

 |  Block 1  |  Block 2  |  Block 3  |  Block 4  |  Block 5  |  total  |   $s^2_t$ 
--- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- 
# of Adults  |  10  |  15  |  18  |  22  |  17  |  82  |  19.3 
Total Income  |  1100  |  1020  |  972  |  704  |  714  |  4510  |  33144 
# Dems  |  8  |  5  |  7  |  15  |  3  |  38  |  20.8 

Assume that $M_0 = 11,482$. Estimate/SE the proportion of adults who are Democrats.
