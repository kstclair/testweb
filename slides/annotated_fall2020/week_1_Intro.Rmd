# What is a survey?
- Study designed to get a **snapshot of a population  at a
    particular period of time**.

- Examples: 

  - [Does the public support voting by mail?](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/nbc-poll-covid-aug30/)
  
  - [What are US demographics between census years?](http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/)

# Sampling Terminology

- **Observation unit/measurement unit/element** An object on which a measurement is taken.

- **Population** A collection of all observation units  at a particular
period of time.

# Sampling Terminology

-  **target population**: who we want to study

-  **sampled population**: who we actually sampled from

# Sampling Terminology


- **Sampling Unit** An element, or group of elements, which we
actually sample. Sampling units are nonoverlapping and must cover
the entire population.

- **Sampling Frame** A list of sampling units in a population (sampled population).

---

# Sampling Terminology


- **Sample** A collection of  units drawn from a sampling frame.

- **Sampling Design** A plan for selecting sampling units


---

# Sampling Terminology



- **Parameter** A particular population characteristic, usually a number, that we want to estimate in a survey.

---

# Sampling Terminology



- **Statistic** A number computed from a sample.

- **Sampling Error** Sample-to-sample variation in a statistic

    +  Sampling error is quantifiable if a probability sampling
design is used.
    + The **standard error** of a statistic is one way to measure sampling error.

# Sampling Terminology


- When a **probability sampling design** is used, statisticians can 
    - study how to **form estimates** of parameters from statistics given a particular **sampling design**
    
    - study how to quantify **sampling error** given a particular **sampling design** 
    
    - **compare** competing sampling designs to determine which is "better"
